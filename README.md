# RRP-Simulation-User end program for the actual scheduler
This simulator is a C implementation of all the resource partition schedulers of RRP model.
These files can be modified to be passed in to the kernel as it transports user-fed parameters to the kernel level which 
are therefore received by the struct global_scheduler and can there after be used for the implementation of the scheduler
